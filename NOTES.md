## ðŸ’¡ What we learned
- How to deal with React on the SERVER side with NodeJS
- Webpack/babel/package.json refresher
- React refresher
- Tailwind refresher
## âœ… Accomplishments that we're proud of
- React emails functional with Tailwind as a single HTML string
- Most tailwind features operational!
- Inclusion of external CSS
- React component props/nesting working well!
## âš Challenges we ran into
- If we had more time, the build process could very easily be refined to not have to generate the html twice
- Some styles not working 100%, but most are!
- Not enough time to make a STUNNING demo email
- Not enough time to make a great README
## ðŸš§ How we built it
- By outputting a react component structure to a plain html string
- Then we used mailwind to extract css classes and convert them to inline styles
- Then we used juice to take ```<style>``` css or external .css and include them as inline css or style tags
### ðŸ’ŽFull Feature List
- Potential to easily build amazing react based emails!
- Nest as many react components as you want!
- Output to file or programmatically use the HTML string output
